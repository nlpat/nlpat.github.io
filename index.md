##### Our Interests
The Natural Language Processing (NLP) group at University of British Columbia conducts research in Computational Linguistics, Text Mining, Machine Learning, and Visual Text Analytics. The NLP@UBC group comprises of three senior faculty members, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate research assistants. We focus on the following research areas in particular (but not limited to):

{% include news_ticker.html %}{: .group}

* __Neural Topic Segmentation__\
Topic segmentation is a fundamental NLP task which is able to reveal the important aspects of a document semantic structure by splitting the document into topical-coherent textual units automatically. However, conventional neural topic segmenters are week at modeling context information. We have explored effective strategies to enhance neural model's capability of context modeling and further improve model's performance.

* __Neural Extractive Summarization__\
We have explored neural extractive summarization models, with a focus on long documents. In addition, we have also worked on incorporating discourse parsing to neural extractive summarization

* __Discourse Parsing__\
We have developed a scalable method to automatically generate large discourse treebanks using distant supervision from sentiment-annotated datasets. More details here link to???.

* __Mining and Summarizing Conversations (Emails, Meetings, Blogs, Chats)__\
We have worked on several mining tasks, including topic segmentation and labeling, sentiment analysis, controversiality and extracting the conversational structure. We have also developed novel approaches to automatically generating extractive and abstractive summary of conversations.

* __Understanding, Generating and Summarizing Evaluative Text__\
In this direction, we have been working on [generating evaluative arguments](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~carenini/PAPERS/AIJ06.pdf) tailored to a model of the user preferences, as well as on generating [multimedia](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~carenini/PAPERS/iui06.pdf), [extractive and abstractive summaries](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8640.2012.00417.x/abstract) of large sets of evaluative documents (e.g., customer reviews)

* __Visual Text Analytics for Conversations__\
In this area, our aim is to tightly integrate interactive visualization with text mining and summarization techniques for information exploration and scalable decision support. We are focusing on creating visual text analytic systems for several domains including but not limited to [meeting](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/%7Ecarenini/PAPERS/birte2012-RashidCarenini.pdf) , emails, blogs, [customer reviews](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~carenini/PAPERS/iui06.pdf), social media such as Facebook and twitter.
