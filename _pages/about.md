I am currently a fourth year [Ph.D. candidate](https://www.grad.ubc.ca/campus-community/meet-our-students/huber-patrick) in Computer Science at the [NLP Lab](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/cs-research/lci/research-groups/natural-language-processing/) of the [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca/). My research focuses on designing and implementing new computational models that enable automated systems to better understand and generate natural language. In addition to my primary research on data-driven discourse parsing --- a crucial upstream task to better understand natural language ---  I am generally interested in creative applications of modern machine learning methods and algorithms.

<br>

My interest in NLP already sparked during my time as a Master's student at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)](http://www.kit.edu/), where I got exposed to a variety of specialized courses on different topics of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Out of these many course topics I especially liked the topic of NLP for maily three reasons:
<br>

***

1. Natural language is everywhere, and computationally understanding, extending and generating language holds great potential.

2. In comparison to Computer Vision, which already achieved great improvements through the use of deep-learning, NLP is still full of major unanswered questions --- down to very essential problems.

3. Natural language itself is ambiguous, unstructured, yet incredibly powerful.

***

<br>

Out of this initial interest grew the amazing opportunity to work with [Professor Dr. Alex Waibel](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ahw/), joint professor at the KIT and the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). Under his supervision, I started working on contextual systems, mostly focusing on language modelling and translation. To assess the ability of a deep-learning system to obtain context-knowledge, we provided the community a [new dataset](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2018/pdf/689.pdf), published at [LREC 2018](http://lrec2018.lrec-conf.org/en/). I used the dataset myself to train and evaluate a [context-aware language model](http://isl.anthropomatik.kit.edu/pdf/Huber2017.pdf), inspired by state-of-the-art translation systems at the time for my Master's thesis.

<br>

With my initial insight into the workings of NLP related research during my Master's thesis and my previous industry experience as a working student and intern in Germany and Canada, I had a tough decision to make --- either continue to pursue an academic career or transfer into a full-time job.

<br>

I decided to continue my career in academia by applying at the [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca/) in Vancouver. My decision to pursue a Ph.D. degree was mostly influenced by the wish to dedicate an extended time-span to an open problem that I am genuinely curious about, with the chance to potentially have a positive impact on the world.

<br>

Since I started my Ph.D in September 2018, I mainly focus on the area of data-driven document-level semantic and pragmatic analysis of textual data -- In my opinion a crucial building block for the next generation of NLP models and applications, aiming at truely understand the authors intention and communicative goal.
